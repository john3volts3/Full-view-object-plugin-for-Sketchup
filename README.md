This script helps to navigate around an object. If you have to change different areas of a large object, you have to zoom out and zoom in again and again. With this script, you can zoom out in one operation and display the whole object on the screen so that you can select another area to zoom in and work on. The script activates the Zoom Window tool to easily and quickly re-zoom to the next area to work on. A keyboard shortcut helps a lot.

Just select an item and activate the plugin (a keyboard shortcut is recommended). Everything that touches the selected element will be presented on the screen. The Zoom Window tool will then be activated to zoom in on another part of the work.

Thanks to ChatGPT who helped me to realize this script in the Ruby language that I don't know.
